## A Brief of the Prototype:
  The prototype is an early warning system for student dropouts, developed using Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits and SYCL/DPC++ Libraries. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze student data and identify those who are at risk of dropping out of school. By detecting early warning signs, the system can provide timely interventions to prevent dropouts and improve student retention rates.

The prototype is designed to be scalable and can be deployed in various educational institutions, from primary schools to universities. The system is user-friendly and can be easily integrated into existing student management systems.

Overall, the prototype offers an innovative solution to address the critical issue of student dropouts, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. With its advanced technology and data-driven approach, the system can help improve student learning outcomes and promote equitable access to quality education.
  
## Tech Stack: 

  The tech stack for the Early Warning System for Student Dropouts using Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits, its libraries, and SYCL/DPC++ Libraries would likely include:

1. Programming language: C++ or a combination of C++ and Python
2. Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits: including the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for deep learning inference, the Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL) for machine learning algorithms, and the Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL) for optimized math functions.
3. SYCL/DPC++ Libraries: SYCL (pronounced "sickle") is a C++ abstraction layer that enables code to be written once and run on a variety of different hardware platforms. DPC++ is a C++ extension that provides an implementation of the SYCL standard and is designed to support heterogeneous computing architectures.
4. Data storage and management: a database system such as MySQL or MongoDB to store and manage student data and academic performance metrics.
5. Web development tools: the prototype includes a web-based dashboard or user interface, web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is used.  

## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  We will update how this works later because we are actively working on it.
  
## What I Learned:
  The development of an Early Warning System for Student Dropouts using Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits, its libraries, and SYCL/DPC++ Libraries is significant and important in several ways.

Firstly, student dropouts are a major challenge faced by the education sector, and this challenge has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. An early warning system that utilises machine learning algorithms can help identify students who are at risk of dropping out of school. By identifying these students early, appropriate interventions can be put in place to support them and prevent them from dropping out.

Secondly, the solution leverages the power of Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits, its libraries, and SYCL/DPC++ Libraries. These tools enable the development of innovative and scalable solutions, which can improve student retention rates and promote equitable access to quality education.

Overall, the Early Warning System for Student Dropouts using Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits, its libraries, and SYCL/DPC++ Libraries is an important and significant development that has the potential to improve student outcomes and promote educational equity.
